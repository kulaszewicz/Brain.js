## General info

_Hello, I would like to introduce
 ReWine App to you.
 ReWine is a simple react webapp, 
 which is using a neural network to 
 determine the quality of your 
 wine.
 All you need to do is complete 
 the form below and see the results.
 The neural network was created with the help of Brain.js library and Wine dataset that was borrowed from
 archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets._
 
 ## Setup
 
 Perquisites:
 * Node.js -v 12.3.1
 * Yarn -v 1.16.0
 
 Installation:
 * Clone repo to one of your local dirs.
 * Go to that dir using console.
 * If you are there run command "npm install".
 * When installation ends you will have all the needed dependencies.
 * You can now run project using 'yarn run dev-server' in your CL.
 * After that project should be running, on default its localhost:8080 .
